<h1>Brief History of the project</h1>
<p>This project was created to help schools create their websites easily.Password manager is an essential tool and although many of them offer freebie versions, those are usually limited to a desktop client with no syncing with the web or mobile applications and syncing is very important. Norton identity safe once a part of Norton’s paid security-suite offerings that manages password is now a standalone product and free. It consists of a desktop client for windows, a web based vault and mobile apps for Android and iOS and all your data gets synced between whatever versions you care to use. This tool can mange not only logins and passwords but also form data like billing and shipping addresses all of which you can insert as needed with automated ease. It also contains a wallet section that can store your credit card and bank details and notes area for any private text you might want to keep. Norton offers a web-based option but its not integrated into the safe and thus you will have to copy and paste, which is not an easy way. </p>
